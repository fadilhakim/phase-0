# Hi! Ingelieur is in the house.

Well, my real name is Shabrina Virta Inmas. I am an engineer turned journalist who can't let go of my love to number and wonder, thus I am an ingelieur - a *lieur* ingenieur. A tech slave. The jack of all trades who aspire to be an expert-generalist.

Currently I'm joining **Hacktiv8** - a coding bootcamp - in order to be a full-stack developer.

I made this readme file as the task that I have to do at day 4 in Phase 0. 

You'll see me more often later.

Bye.
